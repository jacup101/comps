# Offbeat VR - Senior Comprehensive for Joshua Pulido
Hello, welcome to Offbeat VR, my senior comprehensive project, currently completed for the Fall 2022 Semester. Still plenty more to go for the project, but it is in a good prototype state right now :) This repository contains the paper that accompanies the project, which talks about the inspiration, development process and results. Click here to quickly access the PDF.

Offbeat is a rhythm game where, instead of hitting the notes, you avoid them. This creates a bullet-hell style game that is difficult, but fun and immersive for players. For more information on the game and how to get it running on the Meta Quest 2 (although not in a streamlined way at the moment), check out the repo with the actual game [here](https://github.com/jacup101/droneVR).
